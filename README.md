<!--
**KAR-NG/KAR-NG** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently collaborating with PhD Students on a Soil Science Project
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R Projects 
- ðŸ“« Visit my LinkedIn: https://rpubs.com/kar_ng
- âš¡ Fun fact: My brain was full of guitar tabs until I met programming codes!
